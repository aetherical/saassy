> E-Commerce needs a tank, not a Ferrari

* Leverage _Best of Breed_
  * IAAS
  * SAAS
* Low-cost barrier to entry
* Mix & Match services

note:
	The basic idea is to build a scalable robust low-cost
	infrastructure, leveraging SAAS and IAAS. A large part of the
	costs of an old-school startup were hardware and software. Between
	costs, the limited time available for Startup weekend, and the
	importance to concentrate on differentiators, if a commodity
	service exists, it should be leveraged. There is a size at which
	it becomes less expensive to host in-house, but most startups do
	not have to worry about that happening any time soon.
