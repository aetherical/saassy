##  High Level Functions

* Scalable
* Website
* Marketplace
* Monitoring & Alerting
* Analytics
* Newsletters
* Customer Support
* Payment Services

note:
	At a high level, these are functions that all e-commerce websites
	need. With the exception of a Marketplace and perhaps Payment
	Services, a case could be made for the functionality existing in
	other applications as well. Once these commodity services are
	provided, the application can concentrate on differentiators.
